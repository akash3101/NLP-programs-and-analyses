    "Before delving into numerical encodings and transformations of textual data - we present ideas here, that will help us **clean** the textual data and obtain broad overview of the textual characteristics of the **review data**. These broad characteristics are termed as **language statistics** and will essentially give us a flavour of the information and insights trapped in this data. **Note** that in this document, we are exploring two datasets - the review dataset for **HP laptops** and the review dataset for **Lenovo laptops**. Here are some factors we will look at in this regard:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **count** of all words in each review dataset - this would give us a sense of **how much content did people write** for each laptop - this is essentially the **vocabulary** that makes up the datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **average** length of each review in each dataset. **Length of a review** is denoted by the **number of words used to write that review**. A large average length implies that people have writing detailed responses regarding the product. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **count** of all words in each review dataset, without **stopwords**. Stopwords are inconsequential words like - **is, the, of, at, from** - that do not contain any significant information about the textual data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **most frequently occurring words** in each review dataset. This statistic would give us vital insights into the words that predominantly characterize the review dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **most rarely occurring words (hapaxes)** in each review dataset. This would give us a sense of what kind of words and characteristics might be stark differentiators between the two datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We find **collocations** in each dataset. Collocations essentially means - **most frequently occurring bigrams** - where a **bigram** is nothing but a **pair of words**. The output will simply give the most frequently used pair of words that tend to describe each product. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We find **concordance** in each dataset based on certain **keywords of interest**. This essentially means - **to find the various contexts in which a particular word occurs**. Here we extract the various contexts in which the word **money** have been used. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We then find **trigrams** which are essentially tuples of **three words**. Here we extract all trigrams that contain the words **money** and **performance** to get an idea of the **sentiment attached to these features**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, we find some of the **nouns** used in each dataset. The nouns give us a perspective on - **in what context or about what features** - is the product being discussed. \n",

      "1--> Using it for last 4~5 days. This is my 4th laptop. Main usage is for development and when time permits little bit of gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I like.\n",
      "1. Good processor. Provide balanced performance.\n",
      "2. Though 100% plastic body shell, its overall build quality is good.\n",
      "3. Mid range gpu enough for all purpose usage except for high end gaming.\n",
      "4. Okay ish sound nothing to complain about.\n",
      "5. Screen quality too is acceptable at this price point.\n",
      "6. Though not used it, the laptop provides finger print scanner.\n",
      "7. So far no issues with cooling but it's too early to comment as overall ambience is on a cooler side due to rainy season.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I didn't like.\n",
      "1. Only 8 GB ram. 4 GB is consumed by os+dells own utilities. In need to upgrade to 16 .GB.\n",
      "2. Hynix DDR4 3200 ram module. Overall okay with performance point of view but should have put better ram with better Latency nos.\n",
      "3. Samsung 256 GB ssd. Dell has reserved about 80~90gb for recovery partition. With os, Dell's own software with MS office and other basic software installed, 50% storage is consumed. Would have liked a 500 GB ssd at least as an option.\n",
      "4. 1TB HDD is super slow. Replaced it with a 500gb sata ssd.\n",
      "5. Touch pad buttons are heavy, stopped using the touch pad on first day itself.\n",
      "6. USB ports are hard to use. Very small gap on top side which create high resistance while inserting a device. Fear of breaking the port.\n",
      "7. Os by default uses bitlocker. Initially I was not happy with the hard disk (ssd) performance. But once I turned the encryption off, the performance improved a lot. Suggest turning it off if one don't need the added security.\n",
      "\n",
      "2--> I got a detective laptop .It didn't turn on and I had the worst customer support ever from both dell and Amazon.They were of no help I regret buying this laptop…\n",
      "\n",
      "3--> guys , i bought this dell g3 3500 laptop a week ago from amazon for 74000rs , which is a bit overpriced . the packaging was already damaged and opened when i got it but i couldnt find any physical damages on the laptop. i have been using it for the last few days,, the laptop just shut down without any warnings just like that . this happened a few times. and the finger print scanner was also found defective within a few days it couldnt recognise my finger after i turn it on from sleep mode. i also happened to hear some popping sound from the speakers. these were the problems that i encountered .. i think that these were the problems caused by some hard ware damage caused during shipping or something however i have initiated a replacement for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "now for the good parts apart from these issues i think that this is a pretty good laptop for normal use, some multi tasking and some normal gaming. i have to say this has got really good speakers, the sound quality was ok but it was quite loud , we cant find that in most of the laptops now in the market. the keyboard was also good . screen is also alright for normal use and casual gaming . but i would suggest getting a laptop with higher refresh rate if you are a hard core gamer. i got really good battery backup during normal use. that also is rare in the case of gaming laptops. you wont get even an hour of backup during game play, you cant expect that from a gaming laptop. the laptop does not heat that much as compared to many other gaming laptops the game boost button helps maintain the temperature and gives much good performance. gaming was also pretty good considering the price . i tried farcry 4 , gta 5 , assasins creeed . the gaming was alright.. dell managed to keep the design of the laptop simple and elegant . it is not that much heavy . you also get good softwares from dell like the alienware command center and my dell application which was quite helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "and for some more of the bad parts the hard drive is really slow it took really long to load even pictures from the hard drive. i suggest you upgrade the storage with some ssd.. the webcam is also not that good .\n",
      "\n",
      "considering the fact that this is a entry level budget gaming laptop this is pretty good for those who preffer dell laptops and you are limitted with this budget i would definitely suggest you this laptop. you can go for it..\n",
      "\n",
      "4--> After using it for about a month..\n",
      "Good specs and performance.\n",
      "screen looks dull at first but after disabling eco screen from boot menu looks great.\n",
      "price is somewhat high than others but with the quality you get it is worth it.\n",
      "sound is awesome with Alienware controls , keyboard is nice, USB ports are tight at first but works nice after 2-3 days.. only downgrad here is battery performance but guys its gaming system so it can be neglected.\n",
      "tried with many games, runs smoother, you need to disable power saving option to get more then 30 fps.. its in nvidia game experince control.\n",
      "Delivery here was late but very happy with what i got. Thanks to Amazon and delivey agents \n",
      "\n",
      "5--> Using this product for 10 days,no issues at all. The laptop boot time was very fast due to SSD. Display was too good even though 60HZ refresh rate. Battery lasts for 3 hrs on high end processing .but for games using Game shift key hardly lasts an hour. for normal use battery lasts for 5-6 hrs. Fingerprint sensor is also good.Graphics also very good for game no lags at all .Overall good product and also value for money for these specifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "6--> Good product\n",
      "Looks good and good performance\n",
      "\n",
      "7--> Dell has always been a trusted company. So Dell G3 is not an exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. Very sleek design, you will always get a premium feel while using the laptop.\n",
      "2. Lightning fast boot.\n",
      "3. Awesome display with very thin bezel.\n",
      "4. Just press G key (F7) to toggle fan speed.\n",
      "5. Touchpad is super responsive, so as the blue backlit keyboard.\n",
      "6. Great battery life, I have played FC4 for 4 hrs continuously, battery came down to 30% from full.\n",
      "7. Pre equipped with original windows 10 home single language and ms office 2019 trial version, all latest drivers are pre installed.\n",
      "8. Air vent and fans are very well placed for great heat reduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. Original Dell backpack is not given with it which we normally get for free in case we purchase laptop from an offline store, always. This is very disappointing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance wise no problem found till date as I am using this laptop only for 6 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who wants a decent laptop with gaming performance but not very colorful design within a great budget, they may go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looks like a sports car for me and a beast performer. Thanks Amazon team for the great deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "8--> This laptop came on thursday and now today is Sunday which is the day I am writing this review. Today (16-7-20) I was watching on YouTube with this laptop and this laptop suddenly was switched off it's battery was also 98%. But I don't know why it got switched off. Very bad laptop\n",
      "\n",
      "9--> Please don't get cheated. Wrong information has been given, description (along with the heading) says that the laptop includes MS Office but the office is only installed, it's not activated neither you get any activation key or any other way to activate rather than paying extra Rs.5000.\n",
      "There is also a lag of around 4-5 seconds in webcam during recording mode.\n",
      "Please do not try to cheat the buyers by giving wrong information.\n",
      "\n",
      "10--> Overall products was good but when I was received dell box was unsealed. Battery drained within 2 hours during normal usage. I had purchased Dell because of battery backup, it's shows minimum 5-6 hrs during normal usage but actually within 2 hours battery drained. Also during purchase in specifications, products country of origin shows Made In India but actually I received completely Made In China. This thing made me very upset. I had complained to Amazon customer care, they had given surity to give made in India laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I received new laptop after replacement, same made in China laptop received evenafter assurance of Amazon customer care. Again I had complained country of origin issue. Still problem not resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can anybody tell me, this laptop is made in India or china??\n",
      "\n",
      "11--> Not value for money product.\n",
      "Product is Nice. But 1650 at this price range. Seriously. Other brands provide 1660ti on this price range.\n",
      "Who cares about 10gen or 9gen.\n",
      "Graphic card is most important thing in a Gamer laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "12--> Its good and works as told. Not a high end gaming laptop but its great for all the office work and also kids work. It also does play games. I love it. The only thing I was worried is the weight. Its heavy. If you want to carry it around with one hand you will feel your hand hurting ...else its cool.... good one. If it was a little cheap it would have been better.\n",
      "\n",
      "13--> Well, I can proudly say that I have bought the best laptop of all in this segment, just blindly go for it. Why I am saying this is because-\n",
      "1. Hardware is so good like it's so sturdy and looks like it can last long as 5,6 years easily.\n",
      "2. Lithining fast speed with the SSD and 10th gen i5 processor.\n",
      "3. Best Dell service support.\n",
      "4. Amazon is a very reliable e-commerce provider, got laptop in just 2 days.\n",
      "5. Battery life of this machine is also at its best easily getting 4-5 hours\n",
      "6. G button and alien command center when the laptop gets heated I just press it and the system takes care of itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "con-\n",
      "1. Only one that you don't get good warranty extension offers from dell, its costly.\n",
      "2. Buy the laptop when the price drops, I got it in 68k with a coupon applied on Amazon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally I can say that Dell is Dell and the branding matters, don't go for cheaper ones like acer, asus or lenovo, you will regret it. Go for a one-time big purchase and get this laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "14--> First I got a laptop and opened it and after one day I found a problem in it it had a bluetooth problem so I raised a complain for a replacement. Then I got a new one after 3days and the 2nd laptop had a software issue. I am so disappointed with it I got a used one 2and time so I claimed for a refund today I got my refund so iam writing this ..so check and buy laptop a product especially when it is an electronic one.\n",

      "15--> I had some doubts about product expectations and reading the reviews before buying. As I am very much reliable on dell products and their durability I had no issues with the laptop. I have two reasons to decide on this laptop 1st gaming/multitasking and programming and 2nd the configuration. if you are using your old laptop with the old configuration you will find it hard to use at first after 1 day of full diagnostics and setting up my configuration is easy to adjust. Battery life is excellent and up to 6-8hrs in normal mode and when enabled to g force it goes till 4 hrs as its gaming turn on. fingerprint sign in as well as display colors are excellent. mouse sensitivity at first I had a problem because it's too sensitive but after that, I got used to it. startup time is less than 10 sec which was amazing and no errors of update failure till now. Nvidia graphics experience for me was excellent as it was my first time. the Alienware monitoring system lets you control your pc environment as well as it learns from the user daily time spent, I had no heating problem fan speed was good. Dell software updates for drivers are keeping my laptop up to date. I would suggest to those who are looking for a new laptop go for it as it looks good as well as it runs better.\n",

      "Laptop feels a little heavier(As it is a gaming laptop)\n",
      "Speakers-Here comes the main problem,There is an issue with the speakers as they are giving distortion sound...But after technician vist amazon replaced the laptop to my bad luck even the replacement had the same speaker issue..I believe thats due to form factor or the speaker placement...Will be going for refund as I really cannot waste time anymore\n",

      "24--> Awesome product. Superfast boot. Worth buying\n",
      "\n",
      "25--> The amazon is very insensitive towards the customer purchase. There was no physical invoice copy sent to the customer. The online copy of invoice doesn't have serial number.

      "65--> Don't think that A Powerful GPU can improve your PC's performance. Even GPU's possess limitations and while testing rigs, I found Nvidia GPU coupled with Intel 10th gen Processor provides more performance(x10) than the Ryzen counterpart. So you need to buy the best processor to get the maximum performance as most programmes are CPU dependent(including Games).\n",
      "\n",
      "66--> I purchased the base varient of Dell G3 3500 i5 10th gen from the Dell Showroom in Bilaspur City (C.G.).\n",
      "I am using this laptop for about 2 months and here is my review for this laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "So here I will tell you I how end up purchasing this laptop even according to many techies this laptop is considered to be overpriced as compared to other laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first priority was service and according to my past experience with my old dell laptop it was good , my old dell N5050 laptop is running very well even after 8+ years, so I trusted Dell again, Acer and Asus is also giving the better value for money laptop with less malfunction rate but their service as compared to Dell is not so good according to the reviews on YouTube , Amazon and other sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some FAQs regarding this laptop\n",
      "\n",
      "1. How is the design and build??\n",
      "Ans. This is area where I was very much tensed because of the hinge fail issue which occurred in its predecessor model Dell G3 3590 but in this laptop for using about 2 months no problem regarding hinge occurs at all, its design is completely plastic but of very good quality with very less flex from top and keyboard, its USB ports are hard at first use but later on its get better, vents are given at back and bottom with mesh.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. How is the performance ??\n",
      "Ans. Its performance is great with i5 10th gen and GTX 1650 and you will never face any lag in normal usage all thanks to the NVME SSD provided which is pcie 3.0 x 2 means only 2 lanes for Read and write (Don't get deep it's very much faster), video editing such as Premiere pro works without lags when applying any filter or when rendering , coding such as Android studio(high CPU demanding),Visual Studio works flawlessly ,I really don't play any games but according to the youtube and review it will able to give about 50 fps average for every AAA titles games at medium settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. What is the specs of this laptop ??\n",
      "Ans. This laptop is having 8 GB RAM but installed as two modules of 4 GB each dual channel but for upgrade purpose to 16 GB you need to remove both RAM modules for dual channeling , don't add 4 + 8 GB RAM as it will not support dual channeling only same GB and same kit support dual channeling.\n",
      "Battery is 51 Whr , rest specs is given in dell website or in Amazon.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Ports and battery backup in dell g3 3500?\n",
      "Ans. In my laptop the ports were 1x USB 3.2 GEN 1 (5 Gbps) max 500 Megabytes / sec.,\n",
      "2 USB 2.0 ports (60 MBps ), I was bit disappointed as in my varient there is no USB type - C port given but still USB 3.1 does the job for me, 1 x HDMI,1 x Ethernet port but don't know how to insert the Ethernet cable😁,1x 3 in 1 SD card slot,1x audio jack for input and output of audio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Battery backup is best which I like the most it gives about 6+ hours for normal usage and 3 hours for rendering or coding as compared to ASUS vivobook gaming which is only 42 Whr and in mine lappy it's 51 Whr so you can compare it , even in ASUS vivobook gaming battery backup is even less then to my old dell N5050 laptop having 48 Whr battery, for gaming it will able to give 2 hour battery but it's recommended to play games with laptop plugged in to get better gaming experience and to get better fps as CPU and GPU gets its full power when laptop is plugged in.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Display quality and features??\n",
      "Ans. As compared to my old laptop ofcourse the display looks better to me without any screen bleeding or any other issue but going with specs the display is 120Hz , 250 nits brightness (In sunlight the display brightness need to be full ) display having 45% NTSC(Actual colour reproduction capacity when viewed from other display) having much less bezels , 80 % RGB.\n",
      "At first start the display looks yellowish due to Eco display feature in BIOS which is enabled by default, turn it off in BIOS for better viewing.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Thermals ??\n",
      "Ans. Thermals is decent it is having two fan for CPU and GPU each, for normal usage you doesn't feels any heating issue , for gaming yes the temp reaches to 90+ after 45 min. gaming but after G button temps goes between 80 to 90 without any thermal throttling (CPU and GPU limits its power when temp rises too high is thermal throttling), with cooling pad the laptop temps will remain below the 90+ (so for intense gamer it's recommended to buy the cooling pad).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Camera and sound quality??\n",
      "Ans. Camera is 720p resolution which looks better in proper lighting conditions but in dim or poor lighting conditions the camera suffers as it has no flash but for video call, and recording purpose it's better and I am happy with its camera, sound quality for me is great as compared to my old laptop its louder and deeper having no heavy bass.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Other features given?\n",
      "Ans. This laptop is having a fingerprint scanner which works flawlessly, inbuilt in power button.\n",
      "This laptop also support the auto on lid feature means when opening the lid the laptop starts automatically without pressing the power button although you can turn off this feature in BIOS setup.\n",
      "The keyboard is backlight keyboard but having only blue light no RGB lighting like ASUS tuf gaming or any other gaming laptop.\n",
      "The charger provided is 130 watt but when charging it uses 50 watt power when seen from HWINFO software, battery gets charged from 8 to 100 percent in about 2 : 30 hours.\n",
      "This laptop feature a new button called G (Gaming) for high performance so while playing games do press the G button as it will run the fans at max rpm to give the best performance from CPU and GPU without much thermal throttling.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Some cons of this laptop?\n",
      "Ans. In my varient there is no Type - C port given so it's disappointed for me, thermals as compared to ASUS rog or acer predators is not that great but still decent ,yaa you can say it's overpriced but dell support is good, proper button for trackpad should be given(personal con only).\n",
      "\n",
      "Note : Before using the laptop for general purpose do update the necessary drivers from Dell update website including BIOS, graphic driver, sound driver etc.\n",
      "You may encountered some BSOD(Blue screen of death) when installing some drivers , in my case when I was updating sound driver I encountered BSOD which I resolve by updating the driver in safe mode, so it's recommended to install the drivers in SAFE MODE not in regular mode, but if the problem doesn't get resolved yet do get assistance from Dell , but don't reinstall the windows again as it will not going to resolve the problem and installing other windows might void your warranty.\n",
      "Attention :\n",
      "When updating the BIOS do keep the laptop plugged in and keep battery at 30% and more as it is the most critical update which unfortunately goes wrong can kill your laptop although a back up of BIOS is present in external storage but still be precise regarding the BIOS update.\n",
      "Do extend the warranty of the laptop within 10 days of purchase from their respective website to get better support for long years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The warranty provided is premium support ie 24x7 support through call and chats.\n",
      "\n",
      "67--> Guys if you are looking for a budget gaming PC, I would recommend Dell G3 3500 series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost : 70k\n",
      "\n",
      "I just bought this and I was able to play most AAA titles with decent FPS.\n",

      "Pros :\n",
      "• Dota runs buttery smooth on high performance.\n",
      "• Battery backup 6 hours\n",
      "• Alienware Command Center is just awesome!\n",
      "• One button press boost is the best thing in this.\n",
      "• 120Hz refresh rate.\n",
      "• Fingerprint sensor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons :\n",
      "• Camera module is below average.\n",
      "• Available RAM is 8GB which is quite less, an upgrade of 16GB should be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "68--> I have purchased 120 hz model\n",
      "Nice laptop with nice specifications\n",
      "I have purchased it offiline because i got various complimentary things\n",
      "I recommend to buy it offline\n",
      "\n",
      "69--> I just bought this G3 Laptop paying Rs. 75,000/- from a Dell store in Mumbai. The one star is for Dell's customer service & the Dell store in resolving the issue & not for the laptop. It came with a catalogue which mentions 2 usb C type Gen 2 ports which makes it futureproof for a few years & the product I got was without them.\n",
      "I raised this issue with the Dell store & he was clearly not interested in taking up the issue after selling it & asked me to sort it out with Dell . I was taking to the Dell technical people for more than a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "They themselves admitted it is a mistake but cannot replace the laptop & give me the one with the USB C type ports. So no convincing answer from Dell for this product discrepancy.\n",
      "Pls note, this product for the same price comes in 2 variants 1) With a Nvidia 1650 4 GB graphics card & without the 2 usb C type ports 2) With a Nvidia 1650 Ti with the 2 usb C type gen 2 ports which the Dell store in Mumbai is also not aware & he came to know later after I pointed that out to him. According to him the usb C type ports are there in the i7 variant which is wrong( Basically misinformation here too apart from what is mentioned in the catalogue). Going for the second variant makes more sense & value for money.\n",
      "As a customer feel that I have not got my money's worth what the company officially claims to give.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to the laptop, I have not used it extensively & is from a non gamer's point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) I have the eclipse black version & it looks good.\n",
      "2) Bootup & shutdown is fast due to the ssd.\n",
      "3)The display is ok & not bad & cannot be expected to be of a high end one. The angle of view is not that great.\n",
      "Refresh rate options are 60 hz & 120 hz.\n",
      "4) Performancewise assuming it will be good as per user reviews but I have not tested it extensively. I will be\n",
      "using it for creative content & general purpose.\n",
      "5) Keyboard is decent & has an option to be backlit with 2 brightness settings & also to switch it off.\n",
      "6) Command G key on the keyboard which boosts the performance for gaming & activates the fans for cooling\n",
      "which is a good feature.\n",
      "7) Laptop is on the heavier side since it is meant for gaming but still looks sleek & good. In fact for my tastes, I\n",
      "don't like laptops with jazzy colours & lights.\n",
      "8) I found the battery also to be okay giving around 5 to 6 hours since I wont be using for gaming. The charging\n",
      "rate is also not too slow.\n",
      "9) The USB ports are not smooth to plug in pen drives or other usb devices. They don't go in easily & you have to\n",
      "be careful while pluging them in or while removing them.\n",
      "10) Alien command center for gamers.\n",
      "11) Audio is ok & clear. One cannot expect bass from these tiny speakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall it is a good laptop. But an advise to buyers is to buy from Amazon or directly from the Dell online store depending on the price. Avoid the Dell dealer shops since they would mostly not help if any issue like this pops up. Buy the laptop which has the Nvidia 1650 ti with the extra 2 usb C type ports.\n",
      "\n",
      "70--> What u get from this laptop is quality.\n",
      "i am a college student and i bought this laptop for college use only , so quality was paramount for me. I talked to many offline sellers & watched many videos of other laptops in this range with same specs . none of them has the built quality of this laptop. All this lenovo legion and asus ROG laptops are built like chinese fragile glass. they have the same specs but they seriously cut cost in the look and feel.\n",
      "this is a very minimalistic design which was perfect for me as i wanted power for coding but didnt want anyone to see me with this as GAMER.\n",
      "DELL as a brand legit pumps all these cheap brands like lenovo , hp , asus...you can go to any part of the country but u will still find a service center for dell...and their parts are also very cheap\n",
      "look...i wont go into the specs and all because there are plenty of reviews and videos about it..BUT i will talk about the real thing that should matter\n",
      "at the end of the day if u are spending this much money atleast make sure it lasts long\n",
      "\n",
      "71--> I buy this laptop 2 times 1st time I ordered and I receved but after receiving I used for two days after 2 days it is asking for recovery key after typing recovery key also it is not working so I returned it 2nd time also it repeted the same after 2 days so I placed my refund today. I called Amazon service about the problem the said me to call Dell services so I called them they told me they also don't know about that problem so my suggestion to don't buy this product\n",
      "\n",
      "72--> I have been using it for a while. I purchased in March. It has a great screen. backlit keyboard is good. only issue is, when you open the screen the heat exhaust directly blows air on the lower part of the screen. This heats the screen. and since it is very much near the hinges, the screen and body joint gets the imapact, In my laptop this part got loose and it opened. finally I got my screen replaced.\n",
      "The dell warranty is great and service is awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "73--> Battery life very poor: 3 hours, but can use conservation mode to enable \"plugged in, not charging\" option.\n",
      "Audio: average, not upto the level of Dell or JBL speakers\n",
      "Performance: above average or close to excellent\n",
      "Stability: above average or close to excellent\n",
      "Keypad: Excellent\n",
      "Graphics: above average\n",
      "Price: below average: bought it for 86k (incl 3yr accidental damage warranty). Lenovo has lower cost laptops with 5000H series at 63k.\n",
      "Application interface: Excellent\n",
      "Require: Antivirus or Total security from Kaspersky. McAfee is very poor, and should be dropped\n",
      "Privacy: Very Poor, Not sure of compliance, privacy issues possible\n",
      "\n",
      "74--> The product is good and amazing , dont blame the company , but the supplier and the retailor has done the bad work . The battery life of this laptop is worse and received a default piece . The actual original laptop is very good . Dont buy it from any other online platforms or other retailors . Go to the legit and authorised stores like Dell , Reliance Digital , Croma Mall , Etc. Others local retailors might make us fool by giving default pieces . And whenever you buy a product check it when the retailor breaks the seal pack infront of you and the box labels are not hidden with non transparent stickers or it might be fraud . I was trapped by a CSD dealor means Canteen Stores Department by selling it with the price of 63,556 Rs . And the product started showing error since Day1 even without playing any games or using softwares . The video also lags and shows cracked pixels . Be alert and take a genuine product . Check each and every thing you doubt about while buying . Money is earned by hard work and we can wait their for 1-2 hours for our self satisfaction . Dont hesitate to ask them for every query . And if problem occurs before 15 days of purchasing , immediately show it to the retailor and have a re replacement or refund . Dont just ignore the issue .\n",

      "This model has a few cons:\n",
      "1. Fan kicks in a lot, even when browsing web it will start running. But the fan is definitely quieter than a Macbook Pro 13\n",
      "2. Can get really hot at the base. I am not complaining about this. Its a 13 inch thin and very powerful machine, so you will have to accept that it will heat.\n",
      "3. Has a lot of QC issues. The unit i got had a faulty button coming out of the keyboard. Get the product replaced if you get a defective one. You can read all over the web that people are reporting QA issues\n",
      "4. Windows 10 issues. Brightness issues - You won't be able to set auto brightness off. Brightness will keep changing abruptly while you watch a video.

Also the hinge is so stiff that the laptop does not close at all and keeps popping open. Really disappointed now. Returning this one as well. They are so beautiful and I desperately want them to work :(\n",

I paid INR Rs. 1.1 lacs for that!!!.. what can you do with a laptop if the battery runs out continuously and you are forced to plug in every minute of the day?? And if electricity goes out then god bless you!! For INR Rs. 1.1 lacs I expected much much better.. Dell is only brand value.. rest is NOT VALUE FOR MONEY.. my previous laptop was a Acer Aspire with lasted for 8+ years and used to give atleast 7 hours of battery and atleast 3 hrs in the 8th years also. Compared to that Dell seems very useless wrt battery life. I just looked up the latest Acer Swift 3x which has 17.5 hrs of battery life..\n",

      "109--> This is a great all around laptop. It's blazing fast with its Intel 11th Gen chip. It is also very light and you can carry it around very easily.\n",
      "I've only used it for a couple of hours and the only problem I see is that it is heating up a bit. Again, I'm not going to use it for anything groundbreaking as I'm a student, but it's a factor for some people.\n",
      "I'll add more things after a week or two.\n",
      "\n",

      "Had an issue of laptop not switching on after going to sleep but that was resolved after a firmware update.\n",
      "\n",
      "116--> I was quite nervous to buy this laptop considering someone mentioned regarding Coil Noises. But I took the risk coz I literally couldn't find any laptop with this specs at this price range.\n",
      "I basically bought this laptop for Coding/Media and multitasking and to be honest , it works perfectly.\n",

      "Cons:\n",
      "1) Tends to Heat up if you are running applications that require high processes\n",
      "2) Battery life is about Average\n",
      "3) Keyboard is too soft. Some may like it and some may not. I don't\n",
      "\n",
      "117--> The laptop gets overheated within 10-15 mins of use, there are multiple glitches, and the laptop freezes every time you open more than 3 tabs at the same time. The audio drivers were not working even after several windows and driver updates. The heating issue is damn serious and annoying, especially at the keyboard and bottom part of the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would not recommend purchasing this because the tech support was denying all the claims made against the problems associated with the laptop, and even amazon was manipulating and facts and refused to give a refund/replacement. Purchasing this product on the basis of the description and its design was the biggest mistake I ever made, and this transaction has made me lose my faith in doing any future purchases from amazon. The technician was denying all the issues and was suggesting me to take the laptop to the Dell service center and get the errors rectified, which is not my job and shouldn't be happening with a brand new laptop in the first place\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, I would not recommend purchasing this model, because it is poorly built and if you face any issues, amazon's team will not help you resolve them and you will be the one suffering loss and end up owning a faulty and defective laptop.\n",

      "118--> A defective model plzz don't buy it, I have replaced it twice due to defective products and atlast I chose to go with refund.\n",

      "2. Overheating, literally after 10 - 15 minutes of usage the heat raised like I'm placing my fingers in oven..🔥🔥\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Most importantly the battery percentage is not going up, even after charging for couple of hours.. 🙄🙄🙄\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Finally the USB ports mentioned in the description is not matched with the product, as they mentioned 3 ports in the description but there are only 2..🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️\n",
      "\n",
      "Returned the product today.. 🙏🙏🙏\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I can say that this is a disappointing product from dell.. \n",
      "\n",
      "120--> This laptop like many other Dell laptops (including the XPS models) has COIL WHINE issue. Coil whine is a buzzing electrical sound only audible when bring the laptop close to your ear. In this laptop it's audible in the top left corner.\n",
      "I ordered a replacement and the replaced laptop has the same issue out of the box.\n",
      "Coil whine can be reduced if you tinker with the graphics driver settings (or even uninstalling or upgrading/downgrading as that has shown to solve this issue) but sadly these fixes don't seem to work for my laptop.\n",
      "Coil whines are not dangerous/it won't damage anything. It's just annoying when you are sensitive to it.\n",
      "Other than this, this is a good laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "121--> The laptop is very well built and meets the need of any average user. It comes with excellent display, quality build metal chassi (back is polycarbonate). Gives great looks while using, expandle memory till 32gb, cpu does not break sweat on heavy tasks, operates silently most of the times. A tiny coin while sound is heard from bottom of laptop that should not impact the user experience or machine performance. It's great price and steal deal to buy within 70k. Looks are amazing, the typing experience is very good keys are noiseless.. the backlight on keypad could have been improved like HP's but it's okay. Sound is powered by wavemax pro and really should fulfill entertainment needs while watching movie or songs. The hinge feels sturdy and no flex found the port selection is very good and covers basic needs like Hdmi 1.4, usb type-c power delivery and data transfer. The finger print sensors needs some improvement but works well over the time. The fast charge of 65w is disabled by default, go to bios settings and enable fast charging and you would get this charged very fast. Once the updates are ran the laptop operates cool and no issues noticed. The display is great to look at viewing angles are awesome, no colour shift noticed like tf panels. This display matches the IPS level of display experience. The browser and other apps really render the fonts very well and no pixelation noticed, good for coders and high resolution admirers. Okay, anybody want to get good sturdy laptop for coming years then this is it. Dell has really manged well to provide handy apps to take care of entertainment with dell cinema and decent audio which are highly configurable. Go for it, you won't regret.\n",

      "Well built, sturdy and reliable laptop which uniquely gives an extra capacity up to 32Gb RAM.\n",
      "With same price tag, I didn't find any other laptops providing you with extended RAM capacity.\n",
      "I would like to highly recommend this laptop as this gets me the same feeling as that of my Dell Latitude Business laptop. Thank you Amazon for exchange value and ease of delivery partnership provided. Special thanks to Dell as well for changing their design language into an youth orientated Ultrabook. Cheers. Peace!!!\n",

      "124--> The laptop had loud fan noise initially. But after the drivers update it has come down.\n",

      "125--> Received laptop in good condition. However, it wasn't recognizing the power adapter. later I identified that charger port inside laptop was very tight and adapter pin was not getting inserted properly. When I pushed swiftly, adapter pin got inserted properly and got recognised. I think, this is common issue with this model. Another issue what I observed was heating issue.\n",

      "126--> Going through horrible experience of life time by placing order. I was delivered defective product and customer service agent is incapable of resolving issues. Be careful\n",
      "\n",
      "127--> The design is amazing. Looks very premium. Display is very good also bezels are very thin. Personally, I think this is the best touchpad I've used (really smooth and easy to control). Delivery was real quick. Very happy with the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "128--> Duplicate Charger received... Didnt work for an half an hour...Have asked for replacement. Please do not buy laptop from amazon or any online website except OEM....\n",
      "\n",
      "129--> Don't forget to buy a table fan Usha or Khaitan, along with this laptop. Because it heats a lot. In winters you can use this laptop as room heater. For longer laptop life fan usage is suggested. And I request amazon to offer some combo discount on table fans. Or dell should provide some portable fans which run along with laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "130--> I have bought this laptop and it was not charging so I raised a complaint and a technician was assigned and he told me that it needs to be replaced so I ordered replacement, the new one which came in replacement also has the same issue that not charging at all, again a technician came n told me that they are all defective pieces , I have called Amazon services and they could do nothing , I thought like never ever buy in deals in Amazon , and finally they refunded amount and as I needed laptop urgently Amazon wasted my time and they could not even provide good service for a valuable customer like me, then think about new customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "131--> I ordered this laptop during Dussehra offers and I got it in 56K with integrated graphics after applying all bank offers without exchange. Laptop is bought for my daughter and she is well satisfied with the product. I do inspect the laptop and it is really a very good product in this price range. Many people complaint about heating issue, freezing issue , but I am using it for more than a month now and I did not find any such issue. It is very light weight , thin and slim laptop. Startup happens with 3-4 secs . Best feature I like it, when we open the lid of laptop it opens up in 3-4 seconds whether it is in shutdown mode. No need to press start button.\n",
      "Cons: I found that laptop battery is not up to the mark. After full charge , we get battery backup of just 3-4 hours whereas it should run for at least 7-8 hrs.\n",
      "Rest everything is perfect in this laptop.\n",
      "Just go for it.\n",

      "\n",
      "I couldn't check the product in the 'return period'. On the 8 the day, when I transferred all the files from my old laptop to this laptop, it froze; thought it was a minor issue; then the fan got stuck; contacted Dell helpline and they updated the bios and said everything was fine. Still it keeps hanging.\n",

      "A LOUSY PRODUCT.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel cheated.\n",
      "\n",
      "133--> Overall a good product.\n",
      "If you are planning to buy extended warranty, please don't buy the laptop from Amazon. For three years additional warranty, Dell will charge you a minimum of Rs.6999. If you buy the same laptop from a dell exclusive showroom, you need to pay approximately Rs.2000 for the same three years additional warranty.\n",
      "So it is a good choice to buy from Amazon for those who go with the standard one year warranty.\n",
      "\n",
      "134--> Its super quick and has plenty of storage for my needs. I use this to browse, shop, read articles online and have 20-30 tabs open at a time with no lag at all. The same goes for simple programs such as word, excel, powerpoint. etc. Can have multiple sheets, presentations open while the laptop runs well without any lag.\n",
      "\n",
      "The picture is clear and the startup time is extremely quick with the fingerprint scanner working well most times. The only downside would be the sound. While the sound quality is fine, the volume you get while playing anything on the speakers is average - not bad, but definitely less than I would have liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "135--> I can say that this product is really value for money.\n",
      "● BATTERY is pretty Decent.\n",

      "Overall i can say this is best product to buy in this range with believe in DELL corporation.\n",
      "\n",

      "I complaint with dell and they rectify it online. After a month of use it suddenly got blind . So i requested dell to replace it, but they said to contact Amazon, but thw replacement window was closed after 15 days of purchase. I am stll using thw defective piece\n",
      "\n",
      "147--> The laptop keeps freezing as can be seen in the pic. The dell customer care is pathetic. Worse is on the chat they r refusing about any exchange program but not answering the same when I tweeted them. Infact initially they had even mentioned the country of origin as India but it was China. So avoid buying any laptop from Dell\n",
      "\n",
      "148--> Laptop has a premium look and feel, thanks to the all aluminum body and it is reasonably light. The overall build is pretty robust and the operation is also very silent. Few keys feel a bit squeaky but that should get set over a few weeks of usage. The touchpad is best in class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who are complaining about heating issue should get the firmware upgrade done. It's seamless through the Dell Support app (pre-installed). That would fix this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "149--> Product is good , but sealed is loose, it's look like already open by some one else, charger also not covered properly, it's not good when some buy 65k+ rs things, disappointed from Amazon.'\n",
      "\n",
      "150--> Just received the product I purchased in Republic Day Sale using exchange offer. While charging there is electric shock in the laptop. Tried at multiple charging points but the result is same. Applied for replacement but the technical team will arrive by 30th Jan 2021.Now not only I am left with a faulty laptop but also my previous laptop is not with me affecting my day to day work. First time I changed my preference from HP to Dell, result has been shocking. On the whole they not just delivered a faulty product but hazardous too.Sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "151--> It performs really bad in day to day tasks ram management not good at all well I put in some 1080p footage and still is lagging bad. If wanna edit something you gonna put the resolution to 480p not worth 70K there are better laptop in this price the only good thing is battery it lasted me around 8 to 9 hours\n",

      "\n",
      "154--> Overall if u see, the product is a clear value for money and best part is the design, which looks very premium. The only thing that dissapoints me is that the keyboard is really very delicate and soft pressing. That's the only feature that dissapoints me. Otherwise, its a very good laptop\n",
      "\n",
      "155--> Excellent product with good build, layout and neatness. Good performance and battery life is also good. This model is not available online in Dell official website but I don't know why? But I got it through Amazon online within two days. Excellent delivery time. It's seven days old only. Display, sound and speed are actually very good. It's worth buying with some more reduced price ie below Rs 60K..But I paid Rs 64k...\n",
      "\n",
      "156--> Smooth performance with good battery life, I didn't face any heating issue, display is gorgeous and speakers are adequately loud. Design is somewhat similar like xps series.\n",
      "\n",
      "157--> The best developer laptop which is closer to XPS13 model , loved the thin bezel and the screen . As it’s SSD quick boot up is possible. facing a little heating which is not supposed to happen need to check it with dell service centers. And happy for having replacing my old dell to this cute beast.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "160--> The laptop runs well when it works, however within a month the power button doesn't work, the fingerprint reader is not recognized and the laptop doesn't go into 'sleep' mode when I flip the screen shut - it remains warm and keeps draining the battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "161--> I got this laptop with charging issue, its price is 60k and you send a defective product to your customers. Then i applied for return and that got around 1 month to get the return.\n",

      "\n",
      "170--> Battery life is not upto the mark as expected, performance is slow when on battery and when plugged in to power supply performance is better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Light weight yes, but too delicate need to handle it with extra care.\n",
      "\n",
      "171--> Windows crashed just after 5 days of normal use. As I were normaly using the laptop an update popped up and as soon as I installed the update windows just straight up crashed and us showing a blue screen error . This feels really dissatisfing.\n",

      "Able to upgrade also in future, slot given.\n",
      "\n",
      "231--> The display is extremely good with 72ntsc. Battery life is not that good but laptop charges from 10% to 100% in about 90-95 minutes.Build of the laptop is decent and feels pretty light as its just 1.4kg. Fingerprint scanner does fails at times to recognize but is fast enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "232--> Such a beautiful lappy with the new updated features and its thick & light-weight body. Thank you Dell and Amazon for this wonderful gadget.\n",
      "\n",
      "233--> It is a good laptop with lightweight and it is good to buy this laptop. so if you want you can buy it\n",
      "\n",
      "234--> Here are the pros and cons of the laptop ..\n",
      "First I realized I found a far better laptop with more features in the original Dell.com at a much cheaper price than here which kinda made me regret the purchase. But nevertheless here's the unbiased review of this laptop\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "Super fast\n",
      "Extremely light weight\n",
      "Backlit keyboard.\n",
      "Good battery life (3-4 hours easily)\n",
      "Good screen clarity (Downloaded movies in 1080p format.. works smoothly without laggin and feels amazing).\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "It doesnt have a SD Memory card slot (the one I use for DSLR Cameras.. this is super irritating and I am shocked Dell hasnt included in this ). Big miss for me\n",
      "I use an Audio technica headphones. The 3.5mm jack is actually shielded on the outer layer of the laptop making it very very hard for the headphone pin to be inserted. trust me,, everytime I feel the pin may break if I insert it anymore harder\n",
      "Out of 512gb ur left with only 360-400 GB of hard disk space.. so trust me thats nothing when u want to store a lot of pictures and movies and I'm already struggling for space after 2 weeks of the purchase\n",
      "the audio sometimes goes for a mute when I insert my headphones , even after unplugging it doesnt work and it gets stuck, which to me seems like both a hardware and a software(driver issue).\n",
      "The fingerprint sensor doesnt work many times and i need to manually enter the pin to unlock..\n",
      "Default speaker sound is slightly low and definitely u need headphones to listen to music .\n",
      "Please opt in for a laptop that has 1tb hdd and a 256gb ssd version instead of a 512gb ssd type..\n",
      "\n",
      "235--> This is worth buying due to its build quality and features, the only problem with heating not too much. Got it for 64k with 1 HDD + 512 SSD and a wireless mouse with it, Buy it in-store.It's really value for money.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 1 month usage:\n",
      "I felt there are some pros and cons so, I am editing this review !!\n",
      "there are a lot of pros I won't talk about it among all the pros I really liked the mat screen - it is excellent\n",
      "\n",
      "1st issue with the battery not very good and it's getting almost 4hrs with moderate usage(considering 10th gen laptops)\n",
      "2nd the ventilation(airflow) is very disgusting only one outlet with a single fan -heavy noise with moderate usage it gets heated up like anything.\n",
      "3rd don't think of playing games even if its 4gb graphics card and i7 variant because of the heating issue\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't think this is an issue for you then buy it. use it in the AC room.\n",
      "\n",
      "236--> Within two weeks had problem with display screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "237--> Really impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "238--> As mentioned it is not Windows 10 home plus, it’s normal windows 10 only. We have even cross checked with Dell customer support, it’s mentioned wrongly in amazon specifications\n",
      "\n",
      "239--> Pros:\n",
      "Top notch configuration for student/ basic gaming and basic mutimedia purpose\n",
      "Sleek and nice design; Quite light for a 15.6 laptop\n",
      "Backlit keyboard and no complains about neither keyboard nor touchpad sensitivity\n",
      "Commendable display, and anti glare\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "Heating is a concern but the fan does not make much noise, nor the system shuts due to overheat\n",
      "Battery life is only 4 hours running MS Word at 50% brightness (system update, scan not running)\n",
      "Screen frame width is pretty broad especially on the bottom (1.5 inches approx)\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall:\n",
      "Expensive against the configuration provided compared to other brands. But if you're a DELL fan, and looking for a latest 15.6 laptop, then this is a good call in terms of design and performance\n",
      "You can turn off the dynamic adaptive brightness (CABC feature) in BIOS settings\n",
      "\n",
      "240--> Laptop performance is poor, hanging and heating a lot. Memory usage automatically increases and forced restart required. Even laptop serial number is not matching with the serial number written in invoice. Even after repeated request for 4 months, still they failed to give correct serial number.\n",
      "\n",
      "241--> Its a 2019 model got delivered in 2021 mcafee 4 months subscription remaining and ms office and all no present and in dell website they give dell bags with laptops here nothing is provided\n",
      "\n",
      "242--> Nice\n",
      "\n",
      "243--> Looks beautiful, decent speed, smooth n sleek\n",
      "\n",
      "244--> This product is an all rounder. Work, entertainment, kids' online studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "245--> System is not booting. Blue screen without error message and immediate power-off/shutdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "246--> good product, a lot of hard drive issues.\n",
      "Faulty or maybe used one\n",
      "\n",
      "247--> Excellent product\n",
      "\n",
      "248--> Product is worth buying\n",
      "\n",
      "249--> this is a good laptop, amazing specs, the nvme ssd and the processors makes it a very fast processor but the cooling needs to be improved as the laptop gets hot after 15 minutes of usage, however it only gets hot in the battery region the rest of the laptop is cold and if kept on lap you won't feel the heat. Also the display of the laptop is good but for a laptop of this price dell should give a better display with more enhanced colors and more sharpness. Although the dell cinema color app makes it a bit better but still the screen and display doesn't seems like a full hd screen. Other than that there is no other issue with this laptop, this is a great laptop and if you are a programmer or deal with some moderately intensive tasks then you can go for this one\n",
      "\n",
      "250--> I will suggest that no one should buy this product. I purchased dell 5593 and within 15 days my keyboard stopped working. And till date dell didn't even gave me proper service. I understand this is lockdown period but. The dell didn't even kept a good customer follow up\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "253--> I have purchased before 15 days\n",
      "And now my laptop not starting\n",
      "It says hard disk not installed\n",
      "Lots of errors and bugs.\n",
      "Disgusting.\n",
      "\n",
      "254--> nice product ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "255--> Really impressive build quality, great speed, most needed things are incorporated. Its value for money deal. Got it for 60.3 k with exchange.\n",

The machine is amazingly fast plus it gives lot of storage space to utilise for anything that you want to keep. Also 256 gb SSD ensures very quick startup time. From gaming perspective I am not a very heavy gamer but managing office works especially in big data files is a child's play for this Laptop.

I didn't have an exchange option in flipkart and only return so I got in touch with del directly. They agreed to replace my laptop altogether ,they have taken the defective peice in November and ordered a new one instead. It's January 2021 and I still haven't received the laptop , this is very much required for my daily usage and three months without a laptop after this much amount is I am sure not acceptable to anyone. Now, the status of my laptop is being said that it has been shipped still no way to track it.\n",

Some times fingerprint sensor do not work and sometimes it does not power on, and sometimes it diagnose some problem in memory but never able to find it . And dell which is known for its service are also not upto mark . For the fingerprint sensor , I complains they solves , I complains they solve . So basically their solutions are prooving to be temporary, not permanent . There service is something like watching video on YouTube and then having its solution by ourself . And also battery backup is not gud . About 2 hours for me\n",

Had my eye on ryzen gen 3 laptops but did not come across any laptop from respected brands like dell or HP which could be easily upgraded(Ram and SSD) and had a bright display. This one can be opened by a 10 year old, thats the one thing i love about Dell,. Seems like they want us to upgrade whenever we want. Also the display is quite bright and nice. Fan very silent and low pitched. Good read and write speeds(WD SSD). Fingerprint scanner is just okay. The speakers were better than expected.\n",

      "\n",
      "Overall It is good to buy if it come for 62K around.\n",
      "\n",
      "390--> The product is so good but the screen bezels are too big and the wheigh of the product is heavy it's about 2.25 kgs . The performance of the laptop is good and it also comes with 2 years free subscription of MA free premium antivirus software and also Microsoft office for one year and comes with windows 10 out of the box .\n",
      "The product is so good for engineering students\n",
      "\n",
      "391--> Too bad quality laptop\n",
      "That is over priced.\n",
      "Bezels are too wide why dell is giving wider bezels beause at the same price point others companys giving too short bezels as compared to this laptop\n",
      "\n",
      "392--> It is the best laptop in this range as well as in service with best screen, no heating problem , speedy computing and much more.but some people are just making people confusing by giving misleading review.I want to mention that it is a great value for money and best sheerness.\n",

      "\n",
      "I have also tried some gaming and unforfunately there is quite a bit heat which is expected to come from a laptop but nothing to complaint about. Since these are not designed for gaming there can be some heatup which usually comes with most of the laptops. The games were handled with ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fingerprint scanner is fast and comes with a fast charger. You can even use this laptop plugged in everytime since dell uses the power directly from plug source when battery is full. Not every laptop does this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recomend to use the laptop with ultra performance mode while gaming since it will help well in heat descipation.\n",

(You need to activate by opening any document and sign in with your mail id). Backlit key board. Keys are little softy. Ergolift Hinge for Ventilation. Back is of plastic not metal. As of No cons. Not yet tested battery. Got at 65k after 3000 instant discount and NO cost EMI. Only 2 usb ports with 1 type C port. 1 HDMi. Fp sensor is too fast . Will update after 1 week usage\n",
      "\n",
      "396--> APART FROM EVERYTHING MENTIONED IN THE SPECIFICATION AREA I WANT TO TELL SOME EXTRA ORDINARY AND BRILIANT FEATURES ABOUT THIS LAPTOP WHICH YOU WILL NEVER GET TO KNOW AS THIS LAPTOP VIDEOS AREN'T AVAILABLE ON YOUTUBE.\n",
      "\n",
      "SO LETS GET STARTED :-\n",
      "\n",
      "BUILD QUALITY IS JUST SUPERB AND IT'S KEYBOARD IS JUST AMAZING WITH BACKLIT UPTO TWO DIFFERENT LEVELS.\n",
      "WHENEVER YOU WILL OPEN LID IT WILL SENSE AND GETS OPEN AUTOMATICALLY , FINGERPRINT IS JUST AWESOME AND THE DISPLAY IS REALLY GOOD AND BIG ALTHOUGH IT HAS 14 INCH OF DISPLAY BUT THIS ONE MANAGES TO GET A BIG DISPLAY AS IT HAS NARROW BEZZELS.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOUND QUALITY :- AMAZING\n",
      "NVIDIA MX330 WORKS WELL\n",
      "\n",
      "397--> So this is my second laptop and first time i went for dell. So first let's talk about the design\n",
      "For design I will give 5/5 to the laptop as its the best looking laptop that you can get it in this proce range , fully made of metal and has a very elegant design.\n",
      "For battery I will give it 4/5 as when I was updating all the drivers and softwares I got battery backup of around 4 hours when I was connected with my wifi and when I used it online I got the backup of around 6 hours which is pretty awesome for a collage going student like me.\n",
      "For performance I will give it 5/5 as the combination of intel core i5 10th gen and nvidia mx 330 graphics card makes it an laptop for some light gaming and doing some work like photo editing and video editing. And the best part is we get 2019 Microsoft office students edition and McAfee antivirus for 15 months which leads to khushi x 100😁😁😁😁. I would suggest to go blindly go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "398--> Been using the laptop for more than a week ,I can say that this satisfies all your needs , if you are looking for a compact light weight laptop. Easy to carry around , getting decent battery while casual browsing and video around 5-6 hours. The laptop heats up and fan starts to sound over doing heavy works. You cannot use this on your lap as it gets heated up, only recommend for table use. There is also little bit of coil whining on this laptop, I replaced mine and still got the whining sound from the left side of the laptop, it's common on laptop these days not to worry. Can play games also , played valorant and works smoothly .\n",
      "The track pad is large and gestures work very well .\n",
      "The display and viewing angle is also prett. Lastly , don't forget to open Dell update and update everything to the latest version.\n",

      "399--> Ultimate laptop…\n",
      "\n",
      "400--> Very good product. Light weight. Good looks. One mjst by this only for professional use. It is beacuse its little expensive for simple everyday task.\n",
      "\n",

      "Sound quality is perfect not the best... Display is awesome.... Backlit is very helpful at night 🌃.. Light and portable.. Feels like carrying a 200 page notebook\n",
      "\n",
      "402--> value for money. it is simply an Excellent laptop with at an effective price.\n",
      "\n",
      "403--> Oosm product..\n",
      "U must go for it ..\n",
      "If you want a very pretty light and working fast laptop\n",
      "Colour peeble looks so different among all colours\n",
      ".it's all\n",
      "It is result of after 4 month of use\n",

      "406--> As of now it working perfectly, i will re-reviw once again with adv and cons after 1 month of use .\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing i notice is the battery claim they have given doesnt match with actual, it takes more than 2 hrs to charge, 80% takes more than 1-1.30 hrs.\n",
      "\n",
      "407--> Design wise is good but it lags very much and something screen freezes\n",
      "\n",
      "408--> Excellent Laptop with best configuration... Dell makes the best laptops without any doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "409--> This laptop is for those who are looking for macbook like design laptop for windows.. The finishing is absolutely super\n",

      "\n",
      "413--> Excellent \n",
      "\n",
      "414--> After comparing dozens of laptops in my budget I finally zeroed in on this one...Yes,a bit of screen flickering and heating up issues are there but that's there till the update ....once u complete the update and switch it back on ,u r with a beast covered with beautiful design.\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "1.very light weight relative to the configuration\n",
      "2.screen awesome\n",

      "Cons\n",

      "\n",
      "416--> excellent for office work.\n",
      "\n",
      "417--> Sometimes it doesn't supports for touch pad tap\n",
      "Other wise well product I love it\n",
      "\n",
      "418--> Terribly bad. The laptop is turning off repeatedly when not even a month has passed from the date of purchase. I bought this for my online zoom classes but defective product handed over and my performance at IIM Bangalore is suffering because of this and sooner I will be asked to write the exam. Dell is saying that they'll take at least a month assembling replacing the product. Breach of trust from Amazon for supplying such products and then diverting to dell for problems who are not fast enough. I am feeling cheated.\n",
      "\n",
      "419-->  Defective product. Restarting again and again. So much money wasted.\n",
      "\n",
      "420--> A beautiful laptop with amazing performance and good battery life. Despite being part of Dell's mid-range inspiron series, it has a premium design so you don't really miss out on that experience.\n",
      "Checks almost all the essential boxes. Its compact form and light weightedness makes it suitable for outdoor use and travellers. Reviewing almost a month after purchase. It has got some negative reviews, but honestly I didn't face any of the reviewers mentioned problems. Although.. there were some pre-installed app realted issues but they were quickly resolved by Dell Tech Support. They(Dell) were quite prompt in helping the customer. One less star for small touchpad, also I wish the keyboard were black instead of silver, would have made it stand out. Overall a decent purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "421--> Product works smoothly, thanks to windows 10. BUT ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE PAINTJOB BY DELL. Paint is chipping off everywhere, without any moisture/damage (the laptop has been at the same spot for past 3 months, never gone out). Didnt expect such a poor build from Dell.\n",
      "\n",
      "422--> I'm not sure if this is an Amazon problem.\n",
      "But leaving this review here as there is a massive product defect in the Inspiron 14 7490. DO NOT BUY THIS SPECIFIC MODEL.\n",
      "Within 3 months, the hardware, fan belt and cooling has shut down and the engineer opened up the laptop which then has led to motherboard failure.\n",
      "And now Dell is saying that they have weird terms & conditions like they will take 60 days for a replacement, with a body/model of any laptop but specifications as current, and no extended warranty on the product.\n",
      "They are probably selling refurbished laptops at the price of new ones and duping people massively hence they have such absurd terms & conditions.\n",
      "AMAZON, please do complete verification from such mal behaviour and delist these models/ products for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "423--> I was so afraid in the beginning because there was fan noise and heating, but after the BIOS update, it is running super cool. Very good machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "424--> Pros : Battery life is good, looks is classy, handy..\n",
      "Cons : Facing issue only after purchase of 3 months \"Hard Drive - Not installed\", too costly\n",
      "\n",
      "425--> Portability and battery life are just amazing. Little noisy when cpu fan starts but not very bad. Overall very good buy\n",
      "\n",
      "426--> Processor is very slow and making loud noise starting from day 1. Not worth for money\n",
      "\n",
      "427--> Amazing product\n",
      "\n",
      "428--> Satisfied\n",
      "\n",
      "429--> Laptop is not working within one week\n",
      "\n",
      "430--> It got this laptop from office for work. The laptop is light weight, screen resolution is good and the keyboard gives good tactile feedback. It’s a excellent laptop for work.\n",
      "\n",
      "431--> Laptop as described. For longevity and ROI - go for Dell. no concerns so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not a gamer but wanted a laptop with good config, 15.6 screen, core i5 and 8 gm ram. Most laptops in this config are gaming laptops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great performance, display and build quality. In love with the keyboard. A little bit on the heavier side - if you want lighter laptops, go for the 14 inch ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will update my review in a month's time with additional Pro's and Con's.\n",
      "\n",
      "432--> Wonderful purchase, exceptional sound output, starts in less than 10-15 seconds, with right settings you can start and shutdown this laptop with swing of lid, smooth gaming experience, 4 hour battery backup if chosen correct settings, in short Alienware for poor people \n",
      "\n",
      "433--> Superb PC must buy\n",
      "\n",
      "434--> Bad Experience for Hardware\n",
      "\n",
      "435--> There is some noise near hinge when you close or open the lid .\n",
      "\n",
      "436--> Overall performance is good but gets heat up quickly. The cooling system is best but air outlet is infront of display so screen also gets heated. A error occurred while gaming like it took exit unexpectedly\n",
      "\n",
      "437--> I am giving this feedback cause for no solution for my replacement of damaged charger and battery backup is very low\n",
      "\n",
      "438--> Beast at this price . Purchased at 54k\n",
      "\n",
      "439--> Before buy check the battery condition.\n",
      "3 cell r 6 cell r 9 cell\n",
      "You need more power backup choose 9cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "1hour stand by time on 2.30hr charged\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't buy my humble request\n",
      "\n",
      "440--> If Keyboard light must have an option for white light.\n",
      "Type C thunderbolt port missing.\n",
      "At least minimum 2 usb 3.2.\n",
      "Webcam shutter.\n",
      "\n",
      "If these things are provided then this laptop become a must have laptop for medium families.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this price range this a super performer.\n",
      "\n",
      "441--> im using it about 2 months very nice\n",
      "\n",
      "442--> Awesome..super fast...little battery issue..\n",

      "Only bad is the battery 🔋backup.\n",
      "Otherwise awesome.\n",
      "Great screen quality\n",
      "\n",
      "445--> 1)laptop screen bleeds at corners\n",
      "2) consumes more Ram when being idle\n",
      "3)and at this price range we should get at-least 2400Mhz of ram not 1600Mhz.\n",
      "\n",
      "446--> Device is good but the price(66k) I bought it is out of the world..\n",

      "\n",
      "450--> The antiglare screen is really really awesome!\n",
      "Boots up in less than 8 seconds.\n",
      "G mode is really handy and the alienware command centre is simply amazing and the app u would use the most !\n",
      "Only 1 thing which u can think on is that it is a little on the heavier side .although the dimensions are compact\n",
      "\n",
      "451--> Good product nicely delivered and good packing.\n",
      "4-5 hrs on battery if using in normal mode\n",
      "On gaming 2-3 hrs of battery life.\n",
